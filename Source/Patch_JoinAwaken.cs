    // Awakening, and no card is ever offered. That is exactly what happens when such a pawn joins
    // the colony - a recruited prisoner, a quest lodger who signs on, a wanderer, a freed slave,
    // or a psycaster granted a psylink by another mod while outside the player faction.
    //
    // Reconcile it: the first time a path-less psycaster is under player control, mark them awakened
    // and open the card pick for their tier (Tier I if they have none, which the pick's embrace
    // applies). Two entry points - the faction change itself (instant) and the hourly scan (safety
    // net for existing saves, dev-spawned pawns and any join route that bypasses SetFaction).
